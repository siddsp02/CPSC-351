# CPSC-351 (Name will be changed).

Just some stuff for CPSC 351.

# Setup

To set up the project, you need Python 3.12 or newer. You can check your python version by copying the following command in your terminal for Windows:

```
python --version
```
<!-- This will be updated later on to be more explicit in what exactly to do, but will work for now. -->

*Note: If you're using Mac/Linux, you might have to type `python3` instead of just `python`.*

Once you have confirmed that you have the correct version of Python installed, you can clone the repository and go into its directory. Then, create a virtual environment, and activate it. For instructions on how to do this, you can watch the [following tutorial](https://youtu.be/Kg1Yvry_Ydk?si=JRqKblSa8XjmTxY3&t=170).

Now that your environment is activated, type in `pip install -r requirements.txt` into the terminal and hit enter. This should download all the needed libraries for this project.

You can now run the project by running `run.py` in the `src` directory. You should get a basic webpage.
